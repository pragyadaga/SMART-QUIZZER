Reading .pdf
	used the native python pdfMiner - was not very stable gave errors while working with it
	used pypdf - didn't work. had errors
	used xpdfbin - windows based application that converts the .pdf to .txt. worked like a charm.

Reading .doc and .docx
	python-docx - didn't work
	pywin32 - worked - generated a .txt file

.txt files
	directly handled

Summarizer
	encoding error while reading and writing summarizer files
		.txt files where encoded differently
		.txt files modified and rewritten in UTF-8 - thus uniform files where generated
	worked well on small files
	large files gave memory error
	modified to generate paragraph-wise summary

Part of the document can be given as input if the file is a pdf
